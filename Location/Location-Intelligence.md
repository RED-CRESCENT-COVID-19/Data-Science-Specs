# Location Intelligence
The PRC Muhafiz Volunteers will be sending live data from the field, that will require real time visulization and analysis.

# Objective
Use GIS and Statistical Tools to model disease spread and outcome in locations.

In an epidemic Geographic Information System (GIS) systems can help monitor the extent of disease coverage at regional, district or even sub-district level. It can also provide a graphical analysis of epidemiological indicators over time, the spatial distribution and severity of the disease, identify pockets of high endemicity and indicate where there is a need to target extra resources. 

GIS provide an excellent means of analyzing epidemiological data, revealing trends, dependencies and inter-relationships that would otherwise remain hidden in data shown only in a tabular format. GIS can therefore be seen as a valuable management tool in the elimination programme, strengthening national, regional and sub-regional capacities in surveillance and monitoring.

People in the Local Intelligence team will be requires to develop visualizations and metrics for the prevelance, proximity and severity of the disease based on

1. Symptom Data from the Field
2. Population Data from assorted sources
3. Data from local hospitals and pharmacies
4. Social Media

## Exercise (To motivate thinking about the problem) 
What kinds of geographic questions can you come up with in regards to COVID-19 across Pakistan?

Where? Why? What if?

## Steps in Developing a GIS system
There are three basic elements to developing a GIS system for disease. 

* The first, geographic element, involves the accurate recording of the location of each health facility in the country. A list must first be compiled of the health facilities with their full address, and if readily available, the geographical coordinates (expressed in terms of latitude and longitude position) of the health facilities. 

* The second element to developing a GIS system for disease is recording the relevant baseline data for each health facility. The most relevant data required for COVID-19 is as follows:

1. Location of the health facilities

How good is this data? Here are some provincial level numbers to validate http://www.pbs.gov.pk/content/hospitalsdispensaries-and-beds-province

2. Number of Registered Cases

- 
3. Number of New Cases Detected during a day 

* The third element is exposure assessment and mapping. Typically always seen as an analytical weakness, the quality of exposure data, or reported accuracy of the spatial reach of epidemics, is especially important in spatial epidemiology.

## Deliverables
1. Disease Visulizations that make sense. [See this for a high level overview](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/product/mapping/mapping-coronavirus-responsibly/)
2. Metrics for Disease prevalance and severity by locations
